# Test Framework Overview
Core consists of:
 - TestNG
 - Allure reports
 - Slack IM integration (just a stub for now)
 - Selenium
 - Selenium WebDriver manager.
     
    This manager automatically updates and uses most recent versions of:
    Chrome, Firefox, Opera, PhantomJS, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer

### Mac OS Setup

   ```
   sh mac-bootstrap.sh
   ```

This script installs the following if something is absent:

1. Installs Homebrew `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
2. Installs Caskroom `brew tap caskroom/cask`
3. If you dont have the Java Development Kit (JDK) runs this command `brew cask install java`
4. Installs Maven `brew install maven`
5. Runs `./mac_install_browsers.sh`

The script also runs the tests.

#### Safari usage

Safari requires the following manual steps for tests execution:

1. Open Safari Preferences
2. Go to the Advanced Tab
3. Check the box at the bottom "Show Develop menu in menu bar"
4. Click on the Develop menu 
5. Click on "Allow Remote Execution"

At the time of execution there may also be a pop up message - press option to agree with auto test session
